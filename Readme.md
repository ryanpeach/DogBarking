# Dog Barking

A simple for recording audio, and playing a frequency when the volume is over some threshold.

This app has many uses, but is made originally for training a dog to stop barking. By playing a high pitched, loud sound whenever my computer detected high volume noise, I trained my dog to stop barking while i was gone.
